# RandTempNet v2.0
Python module for handling temporal networks, original code by M. Génois adapted to python3. 

The `randomisations` module provides tools for randomising temporal networks. The methods developped in this library and their effects on temporal networks features are described in the following reference paper:

*"Randomized reference models for temporal networks"*. Gauvin, Génois, Karsai, Kivelä, Takaguchi, Valdano and Vestergaard.
